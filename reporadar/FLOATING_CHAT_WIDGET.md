## What You Can Ask

The chatbot can help with:

### General Questions (No Analysis Required)
- "What can you help me with?"
- "How do you analyze market fit?"
- "What factors do you consider for investments?"

### Analysis-Specific Questions (After Running Analysis)
- "What is the market fit for this startup?"
- "Should I invest in this startup?"
- "What are the main risks I should be aware of?"
- "How does the technical quality compare?"
- "Tell me about the founder's background"
- "How competitive is this market?"
- "What improvements would increase the score?"
- "What makes this a strong/weak investment?"

## Context Awareness

The chatbot becomes smarter when analysis data is available:

### With Analysis Context
When you've run an analysis, the chatbot has access to:
- **Technical metrics** - Code quality, test coverage, contributors
- **Market data** - Market size, competitors, trends, opportunities, risks
- **Founder info** - Experience, credibility, expertise
- **Investment scores** - Overall score, grade, recommendations

### Without Analysis Context
- Still helpful with general questions
- Explains how the platform works
- Guides you on what to analyze

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific** - "What are the technical risks?" is better than "Tell me about risks"
2. **Ask follow-ups** - The chatbot remembers your conversation
3. **Use suggestions** - They're tailored to your analysis results
4. **Review before asking** - Check if the info is already in the analysis report

## Example Conversations
